How can we make more use of ontologies\index{Ontologies}? What do we
miss when we do not use the reasoning\index{Reasoning} capabilities of
OWL2\index{OWL2}?

\section{Medical Image Sharing}

What are the deterrents for data sharing\index{Data sharing|textbf} of
medical images\index{Medical images}? We have identified several
important factors that might inhibit effective data sharing within the
medical domain. We will discuss them in the subsections Social,
Financial, Ethical and Technical.

\subsection{Social}
To examine data sharing as a behavior, we have to look into scientific
culture\index{Scientific
  culture|see{Culture,~Scientific}}\index{Culture!Scientific|textbf}. What
are the current norms and how did they come into place?  Within our
society medical scientists are so by profession. Access to medical
data in bulk is centered around hospitals\index{Hospital} and
pharmaceutical companies\index{Pharmaceutical companies}.

Within pharmaceutical companies data is an economical asset. As an
competitor on the market, it does not pay off to report your findings
to your competitors. Reporting negative results allows the competitors
to avoid spending research cost into dead-ends. Reporting positive
results only makes sense if the original company can protect the
exploitation by patents\index{Patent}.

Within hospitals, research is conducted within
academia\index{Academia}. Success is measured in terms of
publications. Only positive results typically result in high impact
publications. Funding of research is awarded more readily to successful
scientists, which means job security and success are directly related
to finding positive results. Gathering medical data is extremely labor
intensive work and is the bulk of a good research paper. If data is
shared openly, there is a possibility that other scientists can get
results with less work. These scientists will be perceived as being
more successful, because they can potentially publish more in less
time. The environment has been described as publish or
perish\index{Publish or Perish|textbf}.

Altmetrics\index{Altmetrics|textbf}\cite{Altmetrics} propose a
alternative to the traditional citation metrics. This new method seeks
to quantify the impact of scholarly work in more ways than just
citation counts, including data citations. This could change the way
data sharing is rewarded.

\subsection{Financial}

Data sharing is not free. Two important factors in data sharing are
the preservation of the data and the accessibility. At the very least,
preservation requires the duplication of the data in two different
locations and scheduled checks if the carriers of the data need to be
replaced or updated. Accessibility likewise requires maintenance to
stay up to date with the current communication methods.
